Issues: 

        320x480 screens:
        Kids playing background image doesn't fill entire height therefore not containing clock properly... 
        pagination thing is not responsive as buttons end up flying all over the place

Improvements: 
        
           => remove the timeline stuff from clashing with the main page stuff for both desktop and mobile.
           => re-attempt midilizing pagination buttons
           => use margins and decorate them with a greyish color to introduce new section
           => link in about us page, probably even re-create it
           => re-create gallery page and optimize gallery operations via database.. Delete hidden photos if was viewed 
              before
